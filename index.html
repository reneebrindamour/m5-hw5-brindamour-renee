                <p>I reside in southeast Michigan, sharing my home with my son, a loyal dog, and two affectionate cats. My life is enriched by a diverse array of hobbies, which encompass mountain hiking, reading, fishing, photography, experimenting with new recipes, and exploring the world through travel.</p>
                <p>I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in graphic design and media arts with a concentration in web design from Southern New Hampshire University. I graduated Summa Cum Laude, which is an honor that signifies "with highest honors." Furthermore, I also studied professional photography at the New York Institute of Photography.</p>
                <p>Due to my outstanding academic achievements, I was nominated by the university and granted membership in one of their prestigious honor societies, known as the National Society of Leadership and Success. I successfully completed an intensive leadership training program that extended beyond the mere acquisition of leadership skills. The National Society of Leadership and Success places a strong emphasis on holding its members accountable in various areas, including leadership, integrity, work ethic, goal setting, high achievement, fostering positivity, and serving as a positive role model.</p>
                <p>I am currently employed as a web designer at the University of Michigan. Additionally, I am pursuing a Master of Arts in Mass Communication and Journalism, with a concentration in web design from the University of Florida. Over the past decade, I have gained extensive experience as a freelance graphic designer. I have also been an integral part of a marketing team where collaborative efforts were crucial. In this role, my duties involved creating diverse digital and print materials such as digital banners, social media content, marketing emails, company holiday cards, posters, infographics, signage, and icons. Additionally, I effectively administered the company's website using WordPress and executed customizations with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I have also worked extensively with other content management systems (CMS) such as Drupal and Bootstrap Studio.</p>
                <p>My extensive experience as an independent contractor over the years has honed my ability to be a proactive self-starter. Simultaneously, my tenure in collaborative team environments has underscored the vital significance of effective teamwork and collaboration. These experiences have instilled in me a unique blend of traits, as I am inherently motivated, brimming with energy, and fueled by boundless creativity.</p>
